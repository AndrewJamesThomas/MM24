2024 March Madness Model\n
Results:
Placement: 9/47
-Best overall result so far and came really close to a top 3 win
Log Loss: 0.57 
-In line with recent years, I feel like it could be better
Accuracy: 72%
-Inline with recent years

What went well:
Abanonding the optimization model was a great idea. It simplified/sped up the process and will allow me to spend more time focusing on the base modeling in the future. 
Simulation was a heavily simplified. It should be easy to reuse this came next year.
Bracket strategy waws easy. I used the simulation to select the Elite 8 up and just selected upsets for every other game. This was easier and more effective than the optimization model.

What went poorly:
I ran out of time building the base model because I was worried about the otpimization strategy.
-next time: use the simplified optimization strategy andf ocus more time on base modeling
