2024 March Madness Model<br/>
Results:<br/>
Placement: 9/47<br/>
-Best overall result so far and came really close to a top 3 win<br/>
Log Loss: 0.57 <br/>
-In line with recent years, I feel like it could be better<br/>
Accuracy: 72%<br/>
-Inline with recent years<br/>

What went well:<br/>
Abanonding the optimization model was a great idea. It simplified/sped up the process and will allow me to spend more time focusing on the base modeling in the future. <br/>
Simulation was a heavily simplified. It should be easy to reuse this came next year.<br/>
Bracket strategy waws easy. I used the simulation to select the Elite 8 up and just selected upsets for every other game. This was easier and more effective than the optimization model.<br/>
<br/><br/>
What went poorly:<br/>
I ran out of time building the base model because I was worried about the otpimization strategy.<br/>
-next time: use the simplified optimization strategy andf ocus more time on base modeling
